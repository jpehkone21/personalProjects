Programming projects I have made on my free time.



Stay Alive game is the first game I have made with Python. It is a simple game where you control the green main character with arrow keys. You can also shoot bullets by pressing the space bar. The red characters are enemies and will hurt you if they hit you. They fall randomly from the ceiling. Blue characters can also appear and give you extra health. The main objective is to stay alive as long as you can. The game will get harder the further you get.
